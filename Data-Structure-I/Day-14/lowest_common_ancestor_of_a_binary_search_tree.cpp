/*
 * Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two
 * given nodes in the BST.
 * 
 * According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is
 * defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q
 * as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
 * Output: 6
 * Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of
 * itself according to the LCA definition.
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * Input: root = [2,1], p = 2, q = 1
 * Output: 2
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 105].
 * -109 <= Node.val <= 109
 * All Node.val are unique.
 * p != q
 * p and q will exist in the BST.
